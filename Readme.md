----------

# Installation

put the whole repository under `/boot/EFI/refind/themes` (or wherever else you have installed rEFInd to) so that the `theme.conf` is located under `themes/refind-custom-theme/theme.conf` relative to your `refind.conf` and add the following line to `refind.conf`:

```bash
# ...

include themes/refind-custom-theme/theme.conf
```
